# Sign-Up-Login-Authentication
The project is a web application for Twin-Learn, featuring user authentication functionalities using Firebase. The application comprises two main components: a login/sign-up page and a home page. The login/sign-up page allows users to create a new account or log in using their email and password. Firebase authentication methods are employed for account creation and login. Upon successful authentication, users are directed to the home page, where a welcoming message, an image, and a "Sign-Out" button are displayed. The user can log out by clicking the "Sign-Out" button, which triggers the Firebase sign-out process. The styling is implemented with CSS to provide a clean and visually appealing interface, with specific attention to centering elements for an improved user experience.
